Security
========

Super Sekrit uses strong encryption, namely the industry-standard AES
algorithm.  We use a [JavaScript implementation of AES] [sjcl] from
Dan Bone's research group at Stanford, who claim with some
justification to have created the library with the best security that
is practically available in JavaScript.

The encryption runs in your browser, not on our servers.  That means
that you can be assured that there is no way that we in Super Sekrit
can see your messages. However it does mean that you are vulnerable to
certain attacks by peoople who can control the network.  For example a
sophisticated attacker could modify the code loaded from the
supersekrit.com web site.

We believe that Super Sekret's level of security is strong enough to
give you privacy from general surveillance, and security from casual
attack.  However it may not be sufficient to protect against a
sophisticated attacker who is targetting you individually.
