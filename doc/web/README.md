# Glan

Glan (Irish for "clean", pronounced /_glawn_/) is an extremely simple
way to build a very fast, secure web site.

Use it when you don't need the advanced features of a CMS such as
Drupal or Wordpress.

See [project on Github] [gh]

## Features

* Extremely fast
* Totally secure against hacking
* Fully static, so can be served out of cheap cloud storage from
  Amazon or S3 (and optionally served through a CDN for worldwide speed)
* Markdown page authoring, so no HTML knowledge required
* Structured hierarchically
* Styled with Twitter Bootstrap
* Open source, so customizable and free forever
